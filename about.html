<body>
My name is Melanie Weininger, I was born in Caracas Venezuela on December 7th, 1996. Since I was a child my dream was to design, and now I am starting to make my dream true by studying graphic design in MIU. When I graduate I want to have an excellent job and to achieve all the goals I proposed myself in time.
